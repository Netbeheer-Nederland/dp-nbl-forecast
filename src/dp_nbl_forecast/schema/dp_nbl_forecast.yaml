      \ together or connected to ground.  Ground is not explicitly denoted as a phase.\r\
      \nResidential and small commercial loads are often served from single-phase,\
      \ or split-phase, secondary circuits. For the example of s12N, phases 1 and\
      \ 2 refer to hot wires that are 180 degrees out of phase, while N refers to\
      \ the neutral wire. Through single-phase transformer connections, these secondary\
      \ circuits may be served from one or two of the primary phases A, B, and C.\
      \ For three-phase loads, use the A, B, C phase codes instead of s12N.\r\nThe\
      \ integer values are from IEC 61968-9 to support revenue metering applications."

  PowerTransformer:
    description: 'An electrical device consisting of  two or more coupled windings,
      with or without a magnetic core, for introducing mutual coupling between electric
      circuits. Transformers can be used to control voltage and phase shift (active
      power flow).

      A power transformer may be composed of separate transformer tanks that need
      not be identical.

      A power transformer can be modelled with or without tanks and is intended for
      use in both balanced and unbalanced representations.   A power transformer typically
      has two terminals, but may have one (grounding), three or more terminals.

      The inherited association ConductingEquipment.BaseVoltage should not be used.  The
      association from TransformerEnd to BaseVoltage should be used instead.'

  ACLineSegment:

      For symmetrical, transposed three phase lines, it is sufficient to use attributes
      of the line segment, which describe impedances and admittances for the entire
      length of the segment.  Additionally impedances can be computed by using length
      and associated per length impedances.

      The BaseVoltage at the two ends of ACLineSegments in a Line shall have the same
      BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage. However, boundary lines may have slightly different
      BaseVoltage.nominalVoltages and variation is allowed. Larger voltage difference
      in general requires use of an equivalent branch.'

      \ a transformer may have oil temperature and tank pressure measurements, a bay\
      \ may contain a number of power flow measurements and a Breaker may contain\
      \ a switch status measurement. \nThe PSR - Measurement association is intended\
      \ to capture this use of Measurement and is included in the naming hierarchy\
      \ based on EquipmentContainer. The naming hierarchy typically has Measurements\
      \ as leaves, e.g. Substation-VoltageLevel-Bay-Switch-Measurement.\nSome Measurements\
      \ represent quantities related to a particular sensor location in the network,\
      \ e.g. a voltage transformer (VT) or potential transformer (PT) at a busbar\
      \ or a current transformer (CT) at the bar between a breaker and an isolator.\
      \ The sensing position is not captured in the PSR - Measurement association.\
      \ Instead it is captured by the Measurement - Terminal association that is used\
      \ to define the sensing location in the network topology. The location is defined\
      \ by the connection of the Terminal to ConductingEquipment. \nIf both a Terminal\
      \ and PSR are associated, and the PSR is of type ConductingEquipment, the associated\
      \ Terminal should belong to that ConductingEquipment instance.\nWhen the sensor\
      \ location is needed both Measurement-PSR and Measurement-Terminal are used.\
